Hello! This is the repo for my little timer plugin for minecraft!
It's got some features and you can always hit me up on discord (https://discord.gg/6YEabdTEBc) if you have any ideas!

## Disclaimer
My code is very messy, and I hope making it public will help me organize it a bit. If you can still read this gibberish, feel free to use it (according to the license, of course)!
Also, this isn't the current release at the moment, it's the version I'm working on at the moment. I might change that and only upload full releases

## Features
- Set a timer to either count up or down
- create holograms that display the time
- Modify the time in some ways
- Toggle the actionbar display
