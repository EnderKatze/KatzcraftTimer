Hello! This is the repo for my little timer plugin for minecraft!
It's got some features and you can always hit me up on discord (https://discord.gg/6YEabdTEBc) if you have any ideas!


## Disclaimer
My code is a bit messy, and I hope making it public will help me organize it a bit. If you can still read this gibberish, feel free to use it (according to the license, of course)!
